This  course  focuses  on  numerical  solution  of  partial  differential  equations  (PDEs)  usingthe  multi-physics  computational  platform  OpenFOAM,  which  is  one  of  the  most  popularopen  source  projects  for  computational  physics.   The  primary  types  of  PDEs  consideredare fluid flow equations and/or transport equations for solute and particles.  PDEs in otherfields are similar.  Tentative topics, including general introduction to Computational FluidDynamics (CFD), numerical discretizations using finite volume method,  mesh generation,turbulence modeling, Eulerian and Lagrangian methods for capturing and tracking interfaces,multiphase flow, and parallel computation, are considered in the syllabus.  Fluid-StructureInteractions  (FSI)  will  also  be  covered  if  time  permits  and  there  are  interests  from  thestudents.Specific course objectives:
- Understanding of how to use computational tools to solve mathematical problems, withthe focus on fluid flows.
- Know how to write computer code given a set to mathematical model.
- Understanding of how to interpret the computational results
- Technical writing and presentation.
